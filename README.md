# AWS Sagemaker Sample Model training and inference notebook
This repository contains the Jupyter notebook that was to be run on AWS SageMaker Studio for the purpose of trying to build, train and deploy a machine learning model via XGBoost to predict the possibility if a bank account owner would subscribe to a particular Portugese bank product (term deposit) using their data related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution [Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing).

The notebook is referenced from Mr. Julien Simon's online gitlab repository which was used in demonstration during AWSDevDay 2020 as seen on Youtube [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOUhLiI85sU) and was updated/modified to run on AWS Python SDK v2.x instead, as the original code based on AWS Python SDK v1.x are not compatible with the latest Python SDK version due to deprecation and modifications.
