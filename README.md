# AWS Sagemaker Sample Model training and inference notebook
This repository contains the jupyter notebook that was to be run on AWS SageMaker Studio for the purpose of trying to build, train and deploy a machine learning model via XGBoost to predict the possibility if a bank account owner would subscribe to a particular Portugese bank product (term deposit) using their data related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution [Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing).

The notebook is actually taken from Mr. Julien Simon's gitlab repository which was demonstrated in AWSDevDay 2020 which can be seen on Youtube [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOUhLiI85sU) and subsequently modified to run on AWS Python SDK v2.x, as the original code is based on AWS Python SDK v1.x, which means certain sections of the code would not be runnable with latest Python SDK version due to deprecation and modifications.
